**Welcome to Bytewise!**

Hey there! I'm Nicolás Iriarte, a passionate software developer and an
enthusiastic student pursuing a Master's degree in Embedded Systems. Currently,
I'm thrilled to be part of the aerospace industry, working as a software
engineer for INVAP, where we're dedicated to developing cutting-edge software
for spacecraft.

**About Me:**

Currently I’m working as Technical Leader in the aerospace industry for
INVAP. I'm also pursuing a Master's in Embedded Systems, where I have been
learning about Bare Metal (STM32 NUCLEO-F429ZI) and Processor Architecture (ARM
Cortex-M4).

Right now, I'm working on my degree project titled: "Leon3 Microprocessor
Emulator for Satellite Software Development and Simulators". In this project, I
am developing an emulator for the Leon3 (GR712RC - Gaisler) microprocessor using
the LLVM build tools framework. The development is being done in C++20, and it
is intended that the developed emulator can be used in simulation environments
such as SMP2 or similar.

My interests and skills are:
- Fluency in C/C++. Python and Lua to a lesser extent.
- Programming in C for embedded systems.
- Continuous development. (CI/CD).
- English.

**Why This Blog:**

Through this blog, I aim to share my experiences, insights, and knowledge in the
world of software development and embedded systems. I believe that sharing
knowledge not only helps others but also allows me to grow both as a developer
and as an individual.

**What to Expect:**

On this blog, you can look forward to a variety of topics related to software
development, programming tips and tricks, in-depth discussions on C/C++ and Lua,
and insights into the exciting realm of embedded systems. From tutorials to
real-life projects, I'll be covering it all!

**Join Me on this Journey:**

I am eager to connect with like-minded developers, students, and enthusiasts who
share a passion for technology and programming. Let's learn from each other,
exchange ideas, and foster a supportive community that thrives on curiosity and
innovation.

**Get in Touch:**

Feel free to reach out to me via the comments section on each blog post or
through my social media channels. I'm excited to engage with my readers and
answer any questions you might have.

Thank you for stopping by! Let's embark on this exciting adventure together.

Happy coding!
Nicolás Iriarte
